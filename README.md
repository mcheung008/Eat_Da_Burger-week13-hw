# Eat Da Burger App

## Eat Da Burger is an application that lets users submit burgers they would like to eat. After submission the burger will be entered into the database and they can choose to "devour" it which will move it to the right side that shows "devoured" burgers or they can also delete it. 

### !! Notes !! : I was not able to get the delete function to work when running on localhost and then I had issues when deploying to Heroku. My instructor helped me work through the JAWSURL config and we used heidisql to build another db. After that the Heroku app worked but I lost all functionality including adding burgers and "devouring" burgers.
